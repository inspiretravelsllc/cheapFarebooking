                </h3>
                <p>
                  Infants, under the age of 24 months, traveling within the
                  United States travel at no charge as long as they are seated
                  on an adult's (over 18 years) lap. Only one infant is allowed
                  to travel as a lap child per adult (over 18 years). Infants
                  traveling internationally will be required to pay a percentage
                  of the adult fare (in most circumstances), plus taxes and
                  carry a paper ticket even though they are traveling on the
                  adult's lap. Please contact our Customer Service team at
                  1-888-316-4927 to book an infant ticket. Infant tickets cannot
                  be purchased online.

                  Most airlines allow unaccompanied minors to travel on their

                  <li>
                    Many airlines require unaccompanied minors to travel on
                    direct (makes a stop but does not require a change of
                    planes) or nonstop flights only.

                    Unaccompanied minors are not allowed to travel on the last

                    met at the final&nbsp; &nbsp; destination. This is called
                    "Unaccompanied Minor Service" and there is a charge for this
                    service. You must verify this cost directly with the airline
                    and whether or not it's mandatory. These fees must be paid
                    directly to the airline upon check-in.

                  <li>
                    The airline will require information about who is meeting
                    the minor at the destination. Identification will be
                    required for the adult meeting the minor.

                  <li>
                    Have the person who is escorting the unaccompanied minor to
                    the departing flight bring a valid form of identification so
                    they can get a pass to escort the child through security
                    checkpoints.

                  Airfares can change minute by minute based on demand and

                  All reservations must be made in the EXACT name of the person

                  Most discounted airline tickets are non-refundable. Although

                <p>
                  As per Air Carrier Access Act of 1986, all US based airlines
                  must provide wheel chair assistance to passengers with
                  disabilities. This also applies to all foreign airlines flying
                  to or from US. Regulations vary in different countries but
                  majorly all airlines provide wheel chair assistance without
                  any cost. If you want to add wheel chair in your booking you
                  can simply give us a call and our customer service
                  representative will add a “special service request of wheel
                  chair” in your booking. When you arrive at the airport you
                  simply need to inform airline’s airport staff about your wheel
                  chair request and they will assist you with the same. If you
                  need wheel during your connections as well then it is advised
                  to keep enough connecting time to avoid missing the flights.
