                <p>Do-Not-Track Signals&nbsp;and Similar Mechanisms.</p>
                <p>
                  Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to sites
                  with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in
                  how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is
                  not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be
                  transmitted, or whether users are even aware of them.
                  Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting
                  organization that is addressing this issue are in the process
                  of determining what, if anything, sites should do when they
                  receive such signals. We currently do not take action in
                  response to these signals. If and when a final standard is
                  established and accepted, we will reassess our sites’
                  responses to these signals and make appropriate updates to
                  this Cookie Policy.
