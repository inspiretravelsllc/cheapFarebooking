                  Additional terms and conditions will apply to your reservation
                  and purchase of travel—related goods and services that you
                  select.&nbsp;Please read these additional terms and conditions
                  carefully. In particular, if you have purchased an airfare,
                  please ensure you read the full terms and conditions of
                  carriage issued by the travel supplier, which can be found on
                  the supplier’s website. You agree to abide by the terms and
                  conditions of purchase imposed by any supplier with whom you
                  elect to deal, including, but not limited to, payment of all
                  amounts when due and compliance with the supplier's rules and
                  restrictions regarding availability and use of fares,
                  products, or services. Airfare is only guaranteed once the
                  purchase has been completed and the tickets have been issued.
                  Airlines and other travel suppliers may change their prices
                  without notice. We reserve the right to cancel your booking if
                  full payment is not received in a timely fashion.&nbsp;

                <p>
                  Cheap Fare Booking may offer you the opportunity to book a
                  reservation for a combination of two one—way tickets instead
                  of a roundtrip ticket. Combined one-way tickets may provide a
                  greater choice of flights, are often cheaper and can be
                  combined on the same airline or on different airlines. Unlike
                  roundtrip tickets, each one-way ticket is subject to its own
                  rules, restrictions, and fees. If one of these flights is
                  affected by an airline change (e.g. cancellation or
                  rescheduling) that causes a customer to make changes to the
                  other flight, the customer will be responsible for any fees
                  incurred for making changes to the unaffected flight.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                  For certain low-cost carriers, the price of your flight has
                  been converted from a different currency for convenience
                  purposes to provide you an estimate of the amount of the
                  purchase in your local currency. As a result, when you book,
                  the amount charged to your credit card by the airline may be
                  slightly different due to currency fluctuations. Your
                  statement may also include a fee from your card issuer to
                  process the transaction plus any applicable taxes for
                  international purchases.

                  Federal law forbids the carriage of hazardous materials aboard

                  selected a hotel which cooks all your meals for you and which
                  are included in the price. Or, you may have selected an
                  apartment with cooking facilities, which means you arrange
                  your own meals.&nbsp;You need to confirm your meal plan, with
                  the hotel directly.

                  In connection with facilitating your hotel transaction, the
                  charge to your debit or credit card will include a charge for
                  taxes and fees. This charge includes an estimated amount to
                  recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection with your
                  reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without
                  limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise
                  tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain
                  locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed
                  service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing
                  authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel.
                  The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your
                  reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and
                  include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for
                  taxes and fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation
                  for our services. The charge for taxes and fees varies based
                  on a number of factors including, without limitation, the
                  amount we pay the hotel and the location of the hotel where
                  you will be staying, and will include profit that we retain

                  For transactions involving hotels located within certain
                  jurisdictions, the charge to your debit or credit card for

                  resort fees, and cleaning fees, which may be accessed on a

                  Your payment is processed in the United States, when we
                  process your payment. When the travel supplier processes your
                  payment, it will be processed in the country in which the
                  travel supplier is based.

                <p>
                  Cheap Fare Booking or the travel supplier may have to verify:
                  (i) the validity of the payment card (through a charge of a
                  nominal value that is either refunded within a few days or
                  deducted from the final payment due to the travel supplier)
                  and, (ii) the availability of funds on the payment card (to be
                  confirmed by the bank issuing the your credit card).

                  <br />
                  When you submit your credit or debit card for a purchase, we
                  request an authorization for the amount of your anticipated
                  transaction (placing a temporary "hold" on the funds). If for
                  some reason we are unable to confirm your booking, you will
                  not be charged and we will request that such hold be released
                  by your credit or debit card bank; until then, funds subject
                  to the hold will not be available to you for other
                  purposes.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                  If your credit card is declined for any reason, we will notify
                  you within 72 hours. Simply submitting the credit card does
                  not automatically guarantee ticketing.

                  There can be many reasons why your credit or debit card may
                  not have been approved or charged. Examples of these maybe:
                  airline could not confirm the booking, fare increased since
                  payment information was submitted and prior to ticketing; or
                  sufficient funds not available on the credit card. In such
                  instances where the fare may have increased, you will be
                  provided with alternate options and you have the right to
                  cancel the booking at no cost to you. When the booking is
                  ticketed at the cost originally quoted to you the ticket
                  becomes non-refundable and non-cancellable.

                  Some banks and credit card companies impose fees for
                  international or cross border transactions. For instance, if
                  you are making a booking using a US-issued card with a non-US
                  merchant, your bank may charge you a cross border or
                  international transaction fee. Furthermore, booking
                  international travel may be considered an international
                  transaction by your bank or card company, since we may pass
                  your card details to an international travel supplier to be
                  charged. In addition, some banks and card companies impose
                  fees for currency conversion. For instance, if you are making
                  a booking in a currency other than the currency of your credit
                  card, your credit card company may convert the booking amount
                  to the currency of your credit card and charge you a
                  conversion fee. The currency exchange rate and foreign
                  transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day
                  that they process the transaction. If you have any questions
                  about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking,
                  please contact your bank.

                  Disinsection: Although not common, most countries reserve the
                  right to disinsect aircraft if there is a perceived threat to
                  public health, agriculture or environment. The World Health
                  Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization
                  have approved the following disinsection procedures: (1) spray
                  the aircraft cabin with an aerosolized insecticide while
                  passengers are on board or (2) treat the aircraft's interior
                  surfaces with a residual insecticide while passengers are not
                  on board. For more information,

                  Most of our airline tickets are&nbsp;100% non-refundable. In
                  certain cases where the airline may allow cancellations, a
                  credit may be valid towards a future ticket purchase by the
                  same traveller on the same airline. Usually the credit issued
                  by the airline supplier has a specific expiration date, after
                  which it cannot be used. We encourage you to discuss
                  additional restrictions attached to your credit with a
                  customer service agent. All such bookings where the
                  cancellation may be permitted must be cancelled prior to the
                  scheduled departure time of the first flight segment by
                  calling our customer service center. We do not guarantee any
                  cancellation. When you are ready to make your new booking and
                  wish to use your airline credit, you will be required to the
                  pay fare difference (if any), applicable airline penalties and
                  any applicable&nbsp;Cheap Fare Booking&nbsp;administrative
                  fees. All such changes are governed by each airline's fare
                  rules, policies and procedures, which are not under our
                  control.
                </p>

                  No additional representation is made for our exchange fees
                  except that an agent will assist you in locating your desired
                  new flights and attempt to re-book the new flights based on
                  availability and other factors.

                  Most of our airline tickets, hotels, pre-paid car rentals,
                  vacation packages and service fees are non-refundable after 24
                  hours of booking. All cancellations must be done over the
                  phone only. We can accept refund requests only if the
                  following conditions have been met:
                </p>
                <p>
                  you have applied for a cancellation and refund with us and if
                  the fare rules provide for cancellation and refunds;
                </p>
                <p>
                  you are not a "no show" (most "no show" bookings are
                  in-eligible for any waiver from suppliers for refund
                  processing); and
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are able to secure waivers from suppliers to process this
                  requested cancellation and refund.

                  We are unable to provide a specific time line for how long it
                  may take for this requested refund to be processed. All refund
                  requests are processed in a sequential format. Once you have
                  provided our customer service agent with your cancellation
                  request, we will then send you an email notification that your
                  request has been received. This notification does not
                  automatically qualify you for a refund. This only provides you
                  with an acknowledgement of your request and provides you with
                  a tracking number. Upon receipt of your request we will work
                  with the suppliers such as airlines, hotels, car-rental
                  companies to generate a waiver based on airline and other
                  supplier rules and notify you of the supplier decision. Our
                  services fees associated with the original travel reservation
                  or booking are not refundable. Please note that we are
                  dependent on the suppliers for receiving the requested
                  refunds. Once the refund has been approved by the supplier it
                  may take additional time for this to appear on your credit
                  card statement. Generally, all suppliers will charge a penalty
                  for refund. This entire process may take 60-90 days from
                  receipt of your request to receiving credit on your statement.
                  Apart from the airlines and other suppliers refund
                  penalties,&nbsp;Cheap Fare Booking&nbsp;will charge a
                  post-ticketing services fee, as applicable. All refund fees
                  are charged on per-passenger, per-ticket basis. These fees
                  will only be assessed if a refund has been authorized by the
                  supplier or a waiver has been received and when the
                  airline/supplier rules permit such refunds. If such refund is
                  not processed by the supplier, we will refund you our
                  post-ticketing service fees applicable to your agent assisted
                  refund request, but not our booking fees for the original
                  travel reservation or booking.
